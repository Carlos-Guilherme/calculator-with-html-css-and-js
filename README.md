This is a simple calculator in html, css and javascript. The body content of the document is contained in the "body" tag. There is a div with the class "container" that contains the buttons and a div with the class "result", which shows the result of the calculator. There are 10 numbered buttons from 0 to 9, which represent the numbers that will be used in the calculator, as well as a "Del" button to erase the entered number, an "equal" button to calculate the result, and operation buttons such as "+" ( addition), "-" (subtraction), "x" (multiplication) and "/" (division). Each button has an id and a click event, which calls a corresponding function in the "main.js" file. When the user clicks a button, the corresponding function is called and performs the appropriate action on the calculator.
